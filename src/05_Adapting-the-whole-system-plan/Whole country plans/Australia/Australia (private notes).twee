!!Australia (private notes)

The last episode in the series "Australia if you're listening" I think is very useful for our work - both because of the positive message around the shift to renewables - but also because of what's not emphasised (a serious consideration of CO2 drawdown) and what's simply missing (consideration of fast cooling).

(The episode mentions Dr John Bockris from Flinders Uni - he was very influential for young environmental activists like myself (Philip) but in the 1970s!!!)
