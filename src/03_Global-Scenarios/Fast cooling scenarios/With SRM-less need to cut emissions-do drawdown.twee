!!With SRM there is less need to cut emissions & do CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown
It has been a long running fear of people working to promote effective action on climate that emissions intensive industries would want to promote fast cooling as a replacement or a delaying factor for the reduction/elimination of emissions and for taking on the cost of drawing down the excess CO<sub>2</sub> in the air  - because solar reflection methods etc. are very cheap to deploy and very fast.
