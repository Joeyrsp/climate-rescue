!!With SRM there is less need to cut emissions & do CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown
It has been a long running fear of people working on climate action that emissions intensive industries and other cost sensitive interests would want to promote fast cooling instead of tackling the causes of climate problems eg. emissions elimination and drawing down the excess CO<sub>2</sub> from the air  - because solar reflection methods etc. are very cheap to deploy and very fast.
