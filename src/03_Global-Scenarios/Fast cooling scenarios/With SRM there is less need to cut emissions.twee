!!With SRM there is less need to cut emissions
It has been a long running fear of people working to promote effective action on climate that emissions intensive industries would want to promote fast cooling as a replacement or a delaying factor for the reduction/elimination of emissions - because solar reflection methods etc. are very cheap to deploy and very fast.
