!!20 years of research then 50% cooling
David Keith and some other climate researchers with an interest in fast cooling have published arguments that:
*it might be necessary to do further research on solar reflection methods and other methods such as cirrus cloud thinning and then make a deploy/not deploy decision;
*at the point of deployment fast cooling methods might only be used to offset half the warming potential of greenhouse gases and other warming factors.
