RSTI has been developing a scenario in which fast cooling methods, if they can be made safe, would be deployed as soon as possible in conjunction with vigorous programs to eliminate emissions and draw down the excess CO2 in the air.  This scenario draws on the approach that competent governments applie to the development of vaccines and treatments during the covid pandemic - promote and regulate concurrently.
