!!Maintain the taboo, no field research, no deployment
A number of organisations (eg. ETC, Heinrich Boell Foundation, Geoengineering Monitor, Hands Off Mother Earth, Solar Geoengineering Non-Use Agreement) are campaigning against field research on fast cooling (solar geoengineering) and against deployment.  These organisations have been leaders in creating a strong taboo against any serious consideration of fast cooling.

It is likely that the demand that no field research is based on not only a fear of creating a slippery slope to deployment, but also because in the absence of any research data based on field research it will always be rational to say that deployment should not be contemplated because we know too little about how the earth would actually respond.
