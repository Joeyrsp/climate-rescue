!!!<small>(Opportunity multiplying â€“ Framework)</small><br>25. Truth and value
The Opportunity Multiplying method requires the user to make the prudent assumption that there is at least a little truth or value in everyone's views. The problem is to identify the nature of this truth. The importance of this assumption is that it helps you to avoid:
*the single-goal problem-solving approach,
*dismissing views or ideas simply because they have been badly formulated or because they have been put forward by people whose views you may not normally approve of or respect.
As a general rule, there is something important to be gleaned whenever someone is passionate or immovable about an issue, no matter how peculiar or poorly argued their views may seem. It may take some digging and analysing to find out what this important information is.
