!!!Science-based targets?
It is commonly argued that we should use science-based target to drive climate policy.  But if science is the only reference point then logically you can't derive any targets at all because the role of science is to understand how the universe works or might work in different contexts - it can't tell you what you ''ought'' to do.

What you "ought" to do has to been derived first from consideration of ethics and interests.  Then you apply science to derive targets to achieve the high-level goals that emerge from the consideration of ethics and interests.
