!!!<small>(Opportunity multiplying â€“ Framework)</small><br>5. Direct analysis
Our culture and our experience colour our perceptions of the world. For example, we often carry unconscious notions about the economic or political feasibility of future options that lead us to dismiss these options before they have been tested.

The idea of carrying out a 'direct analysis' is to try to imagine future options actually operating. If it seems that they would be practical in a physical and social sense and that they would yield worthwhile social and environmental benefits then strategies can probably be devised to make these options feasible in economic and political terms.
