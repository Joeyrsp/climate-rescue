To understand how complex systems work it is essential that a person tries to see the world from the perspective of each of the system elements. This principle is summed up in the adage that one should be able to put oneself in other people's shoes. Only in this way can one begin to understand the motivations, needs, preferences etc. of other parties and therefore be in a position to predict what their response would be in different situations.
