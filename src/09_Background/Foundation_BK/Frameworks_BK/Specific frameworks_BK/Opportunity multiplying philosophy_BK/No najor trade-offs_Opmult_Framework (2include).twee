!!!<small>(Opportunity multiplying â€“ Framework)</small><br>3. No major trade-offs
Traditional thinking holds that when more than one objective is being pursued, not all of the objectives can be fully achieved. It is assumed that a major trade-off will be necessary.

However using a creative approach to problem solving or opportunity multiplying, especially where innovation over a period of time is possible, it is often possible to avoid trade-offs on the major issues altogether. To achieve such a result it may be necessary to accept trade-offs on less important questions.
