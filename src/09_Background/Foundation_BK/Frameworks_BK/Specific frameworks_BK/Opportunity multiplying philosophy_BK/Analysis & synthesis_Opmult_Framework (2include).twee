It is common knowledge that a ''problem'' needs to be ''analysed'' (i.e. taken apart) in order to be understood. What is frequently not recognised is that the development of a ''solution'' requires a process of ''synthesis'' (i.e. integration or bringing together).

While this might sound rather obvious, people often are not aware that effective problem solving requires a two phase iterative, or repeated, process involving first analysis and then synthesis.

You begin with the analysis of the existing system. All the relevant sub-elements are identified, especially those which appear to require changing or might be affected by proposed changes. Then, swinging into the synthesis process, you recombine or cluster the changed and unchanged sub-elements to form a new hypothetical complete system. The new system must then be analysed to see what the chances are that the chosen goals will actually be achieved. If reasonable success is unlikely you must once again use the synthesis process to generate a more effective hypothetical system. The cycle of analysis and synthesis continues until you are satisfied with the final result.
