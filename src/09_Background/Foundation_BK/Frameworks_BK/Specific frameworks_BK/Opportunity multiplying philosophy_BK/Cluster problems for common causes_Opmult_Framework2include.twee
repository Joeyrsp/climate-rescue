!!!<small>(Opportunity multiplying â€“ Framework)</small><br>11. Cluster problems to find common causes
It is no coincidence that prevention is better than cure. Most problems have many symptoms. Suppressing each one of the symptoms can be time consuming, expensive, prone to secondary complications and often ultimately futile. It is far better to treat the cause. Often by opening one's mind to a whole array of problems at once, it is possible to mentally cluster them around common causative factors. Thus, by making the initial problem ''exploration'' phase more complex, it is possible to make the problem ''solving'' stage much simpler, easier and more effective.
