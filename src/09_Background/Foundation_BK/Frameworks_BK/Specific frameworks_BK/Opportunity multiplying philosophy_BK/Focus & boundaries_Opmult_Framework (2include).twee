!!!<small>(Opportunity multiplying â€“ Framework)</small><br>17. Focus and boundaries
Large or complex problems must be reduced in "size" one way or another for human beings to be able to solve them. However, the choice of the reduction method makes a significant difference to the nature of the resulting solutions.

Rather than taking a large system and breaking it into a series of completely isolated pieces, the Opportunity Multiplying technique limits the problem solving task by selecting a clearly identifiable focus. Exploration of this study focus is not limited by defined boundaries, since in the real world everything is connected to everything else, but instead excursions away from the focus are judged by their contribution to the development of solutions which satisfy the declared value goals.

One of the important features of the Opportunity Multiplying method is that it controls this process of moving away from the study or problem focus.
