!!!<small>(Opportunity multiplying â€“ Framework)</small><br>8. Broaden your subjective identification
The historical trend is for society's framework of concern to broaden over time.

We usually divide the world into an in-group (with whom we identify and toward whom we feel concern and empathy) and an out-group (for whom we have little or no concern). The commonest strategy for problem solving for the benefit of the in-group is to try to shift the burden of the problem from the in-group to the out-group. But if the span of concern tends to widen over time, then the chances are that past problem solving efforts will have significantly worsened the situation for future members of the in-group who were previously part of the out-group.

An Opportunity Multiplying approach would aim to anticipate this widening of concern with the aim of developing solutions which eliminate the problem rather than just shift its burden. Using a biological metaphor, you try to avoid exploitative (or parasitic) relations with other parts of the system and instead aim for a symbiotic (living together) relationship. In other words, there should be a mutual exchange of benefits rather than a one way take.
