!!!<small>(Opportunity multiplying – Framework)</small><br>23. Intellectual rigour and moral courage
To make the Opportunity Multiplying method work it is essential that it is applied with full intellectual rigour (and vigour too!). This is because the problems it is designed to solve are the hard ones which are not amenable to solution by other less stringent methods. If you want the results you have to put in the effort. (It is time the "too hard basket" was a temporary stopping place on the way to a solution rather than the end of a dead-end road.)

With Opportunity Multiplying you do not stop using the method because it seems too hard, you simply take a little longer, or work on improving the method itself as it applies to a particular application.

It is also critical that political pressures or “realities” are not allowed to constrain the application of the method, but instead such pressures or "realities" are entered as data for consideration using the Opportunity Multiplying method. They are analysed as part of the problem under consideration. There should be no hidden agendas.
