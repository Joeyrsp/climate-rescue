!!!<small>(Opportunity multiplying â€“ Framework)</small><br>22. Paradox and the resolution of apparent conflicts
Frequently problems seem to have paradoxical or contradictory elements which make it difficult to arrive at a satisfactory solution. In this situation the traditional problem solving method would normally recommend developing some sort of halfway compromise.

This response is not ideal however, since many so-called paradoxes are not irresolvable, because they are not "real" but instead arise from semantic confusions, habit-caused blind spots, or an inadequate understanding of the problem or the affected system. The Opportunity Multiplying method assumes that paradoxes or contradiction are usually more apparent than real, and that you should therefore set out to discover where the confusion has arisen.  Eli Goldratt, in "It's not luck" makes very active use of paradox resolution as a method for creating powerful solutions - see the [[reference list|References (gather)]]. 

A classic cause of misunderstanding is exposed in the "elephant and blind people" parable. The story goes that a group of blind people were examining a new living thing. To one it seemed to be like a snake, to another like a tree, etc, etc, and a strong argument developed over who was correct. In reality none were completely right and none completely wrong. Each was giving an accurate description of part of the creature, which was in fact an elephant, but was falsely assuming that they had perceived the whole of the situation. This sort of distorted perception is the source of much meaningless argument. In any argument it is important to determine whether people are at cross purposes because they are focussed on different, but nevertheless relevant, parts of a larger system.
