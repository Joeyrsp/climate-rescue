!!!<small>(Opportunity multiplying â€“ Framework)</small><br>19. Make problems bigger to make them easier to solve
It is often assumed that a difficult problem can be best solved if small pieces of it are taken at a time and solved separately. This is true if the 'problem' is in fact a cluster of semi-independent sub-problems. However this is often not the case.

The Opportunity Multiplying method proposes that the way to make a problem simpler is to make it 'bigger' rather than smaller (that is take in more of the relevant systems rather than less in order to expand the range of options).
