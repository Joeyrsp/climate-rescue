!!!<small>(Opportunity multiplying â€“ Framework)</small><br>13. Problems into opportunities; constraints into goals
A productive way of drawing together the multiple goals and multi-problem solution approaches is to try to transform problems into:
*goals, or
*opportunities.
If an action has to be taken to solve one problem, some extra effort should be put into finding additional spin-off benefits. Also, rather than spending a lot of time after the event trying to stop or substantially modify undesirable projects, effort should be put into devising projects that meet the desired goals right from the start.
