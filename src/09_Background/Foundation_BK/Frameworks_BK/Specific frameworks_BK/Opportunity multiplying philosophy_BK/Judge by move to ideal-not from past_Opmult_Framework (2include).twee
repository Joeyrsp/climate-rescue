!!!<small>(Opportunity multiplying â€“ Framework)</small><br>31. Judge success by progress to the ideal rather than movement from past bad performance
Success in any program should be judged by the extent to which the ideal is actually achieved. It is not enough to simply look back to past performance and see some increment of improvement. This is because many serious problems need to be solved within a finite time frame or need to be substantially achieved before a satisfactory result can be claimed.
