While the aim should always be to find win-win solutions to problems conflict is sometimes inevitable. If other people or organisations believe that a win-lose approach is the only possible option or if they do not hold core values similar to the other parties to a negotiation then there may be the basis for unavoidable conflict. This cannot be run away from. If it is not possible to convince the other parties to use a win-win approach then you will have to fight to defend your core values. But even in the latter case it may be possible to fight for solutions that are win-win solutions in any case - despite the lack of interest from the other parties.
