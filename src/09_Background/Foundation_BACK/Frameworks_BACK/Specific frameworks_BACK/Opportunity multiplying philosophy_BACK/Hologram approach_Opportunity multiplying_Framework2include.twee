!!!<small>(Opportunity multiplying â€“ Framework)</small><br>29. The hologram approach - the whole in the parts
Holographic photographs have the unusual feature that they will still display a 'complete' view of the subject even if they are cut in half [3]. Thus the 'whole' seems to reside in all the parts. This concept can be applied as an analogy to organisations.

If an opportunity or a problem needs to be pursued by many people or units over a long period of time, then the hologram approach is probably called for. That is, each person or unit not only has their special tasks to perform but they also take on responsibility for the whole project. So if a person or a unit ceases to be active or some part of the system is missing or under-performing then one or more of the other units takes action to remedy the deficiency. This approach creates enormous robustness/resilience.

This concept is reflected also in the notion of [[unilateral cooperation|Unilateral cooperation_Opportunity multiplying_Framework]].
