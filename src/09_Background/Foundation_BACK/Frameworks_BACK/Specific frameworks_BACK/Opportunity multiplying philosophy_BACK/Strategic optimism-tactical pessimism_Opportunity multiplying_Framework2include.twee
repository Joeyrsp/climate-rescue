!!!<small>(Opportunity multiplying – Framework)</small><br>1. Strategic optimism / tactical pessimism
To maximise what can be achieved, it pays to adopt an optimistic approach to high-level goals, programs and projects, as a whole. But to ensure that this optimism is not misplaced, it is useful, at the level of specifics, to imagine that the worst ''could'' happen and then plan to make sure it doesn't or plan to recover rapidly from any set backs that might occur . That is, one adopts an optimistic approach at the strategic level, but a pessimistic approach at the detailed or tactical level. Taken as a whole, this this approach can be described as //“strategic optimism & tactical pessimism”//.
