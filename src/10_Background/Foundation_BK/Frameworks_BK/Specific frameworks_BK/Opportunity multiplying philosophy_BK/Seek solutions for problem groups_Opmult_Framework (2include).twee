Not only does Opportunity Multiplying involve clustering many symptoms of problems and then solving the root cause, it also involves a process of clustering and integrating, or 'double decking', the implementation programs. This makes for much more economical implementation mechanisms or 'vehicles'. To find opportunities for double decking you ask yourself, not whether the problems have a common cause, but rather, whether the implementation programs for a number of problems have a common character. If so, a joint program might be more effective or efficient.
