!!!<small>(Opportunity multiplying â€“ Framework)</small><br>7. Subject/object duality
At first glance "means" and "ends" seem to be completely separate categories. Means are seen as objects, that is the independent instruments or techniques for achieving the ends or goals. However real life is not as clear cut as this. Often there is a very tangible link or overlap between the ends (the goals and their beneficiaries) and the means (the available resources).

The usual subjects of concern are people or human communities or other living things. We empathise or identify with these subjects and have subjective thoughts and feelings about them. However, often people and other living species themselves play an instrumental role in achieving their own desired goals. They are the means to their own ends i.e. people and the other species are simultaneously the subject and the object of the problem solving process.

If a problem is to be solved effectively, so that it takes into account the total situation, it is necessary to respond both objectively and subjectively at the same time. Real world problems involve a subject/object duality.
