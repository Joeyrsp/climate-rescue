:: Chain of responsibility_Def (2include) DB {"position":"7725,7700"}
Occupational health and safety law and supply chain impact management has created the principle of a 'chain of responsibility'.  The employer is responsible for ensuring safe working conditions for employees.  If an accident occurs and the employer is taken to court, a forensic examination takes place to see whether the employer can demonstrate the operation of an effective chain of responsibility: that is, were they aware of their responsibilities [[(duty of care)|Definitions, acronyms, concepts (gather)]], and did they put reasonable systems, staff allocations and training, budgets, and measures in place to ensure effective actions were taken to translate the responsibility from intent to effective action.  This principle can be extended to climate action to governments, communities, organisations and even indivduals.
