!!Ocean acidification is not strictly a climate issue
Ocean acidification is caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide disolving in marine waters.

Stricly it is not a climate issue, rather it has a related cause to global warming (ie. rising CO<sub>2</sub> levels).

There are feedbacks from climate change though, in that global warming can result in the release of more CO<sub>2</sub> from natural carbon stores (soils, the permafrost, burned and damaged forests, etc.) nd that in turn adds to increased acidification.
