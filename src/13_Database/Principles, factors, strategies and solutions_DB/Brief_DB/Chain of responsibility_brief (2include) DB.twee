Occupational health and safety law and supply chain impact management has created a principle that will be vital for action on climate, and that is the concept of a 'chain of responsibility'.  Under occupational health and safety law, the employer is responsible for ensuring safe working conditions for employees.  If an accident occurs and the employer is taken to court, a forensic examination takes place to see whether the employer can demonstrate the operation of an effective chain of responsibility: that is, were they aware of their responsibilities (duty of care), and did they put reasonable systems, staff allocations and training, budgets, and measures in place to ensure effective actions were taken to translate the responsibility from intent to effective action.

We need to apply this approach to climate action because there is currently a huge gap between what would need to be done to protect the climate vulnerable and the policies that are being applied and even the policies that are being advocated for climate action.
