!!Ramping up
The Climate Rescue program needs to build to a huge level of effect in the world, but has to start with virtually no initial resources.  The program has to build its intellectual framework, methods, culture and capacity from a near zero base which will require extremely high levels of innovation and learning and capacity building.   This will require a conscious and energetic ramping up process.
