!!Focuses for power building and mobilisation modes
There are multiple sources of power in societies.  Any source of power ignored for too long will provide a point of leverage for climate damaging forces to mobilise around.  But when ramping up with limited resources it may not be possible to start with universal coverage of all the sources of power and all the mobilisation modes.  If multiple organisations work together then full coverage might be achieved faster.
