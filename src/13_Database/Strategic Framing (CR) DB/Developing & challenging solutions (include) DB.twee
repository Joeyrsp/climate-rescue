!!Developing and challenging solutions
To develop good solutions people need to be keen and creative, but the risk (moral hazard) is that the creators fall in love with their creations and can be somewhat blind to their weak points.

So we also need people to take on the critic role to find the weaknesses in the proposals.  But the moral hazard here is that critics get more excited about getting a scalp than they are about finding the true value of the proposals they are critiquing.

So we also need people to play a third role of ensuring fair play between the contesting parties and ensuring validity of arguments in any direction, without being committed to the outcome.  The moral hazard here is that people in this role hide their personal preferences but nevertheless let those preferences influence their ostensibly neutral role.
