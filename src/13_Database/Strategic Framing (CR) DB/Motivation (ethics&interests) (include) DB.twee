!!Motivation (ethics and interests)
Motivation is the “energy” that drives not for profit action.  To maximise its chance of success a climate rescue program will need to find or trigger and mobilise strong and widespread motivation – and then help people to translate that motivation into effective action.

Motivations arise from ethics and interests, and interests can be divided into enlightened and unenlightened self-interest.
