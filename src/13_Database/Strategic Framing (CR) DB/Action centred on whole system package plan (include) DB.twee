!!Action centred on whole system package plan
The climate issue is huge and complicated.  No one individual or organisation can act on everything or think about everything, so the usual response is to select a piece of climate action to work on and hope that other people and organisations will pick up everything else that needs to be thought about or done.

The problem with this approach is that noone really knows what the gaps in understanding and action are.

It should not be a surprise that that this approach is not how any complex projects with strong requirements for safety is managed eg. air liner design and manufacturing, the constructon of sky scrapers.  The managers of these projects draw on a well developed methodology for complex program management that is held together by a planning process for a whole-system package of actions.

If we are to have any success in protecting the climate vulnerable we will have to apply this whole system planning process to climate action.
