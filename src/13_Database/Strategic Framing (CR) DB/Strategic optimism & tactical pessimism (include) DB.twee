!!Strategic optimism and tactical pessimism
To be willing to //''take on''// worthwhile but difficult goals requires an attitude of strategic //''optimism''//.  But to //''succeed''// with a difficult-to-achieve goal requires an attitude of tactical //''pessimism''// so that no risk or barrier is ignored and left unattended.  A individual person can combine both strategic optimism and tactical pessimism.
