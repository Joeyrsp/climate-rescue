Plus putting protection measures in place will take time, so further losses will most likely occur.  In the face of this, some people feel that a goal of protecting the climate vulnerable is no longer possible.  But a response like this would throw out the baby with the bathwater.  Despite prior losses, commitment to the protection of the remaining climate vulnerable is even more important.
