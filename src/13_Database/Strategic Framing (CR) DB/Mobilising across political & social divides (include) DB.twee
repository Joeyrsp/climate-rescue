!!!Mobilising across political and social divides
The climate is shared by every living thing and by every person regardless of their politics or identities so people should be mobilised across political and social divides to restore and maintain a naturally safe climate.

Also in functioning democracies governments usually change every so often, so all political coalitions that could form governments will need to support climate rescue policies if implementation is to be maintained.
