!!Building a flywheel to drive the program
Jim Collins, in his book “Good to Great” developed the idea that organisations can often build success if they can create a cycle of actions that feed into each other creating a process of momentum building.  This concept is summarised in a short monograph: “Turning the Flywheel”[[|https://www.jimcollins.com/books/turning-the-flywheel.html]].  Building a great program of action never happens all at once.  There’s no single defining action.  Rather the process resembles relentlessly pushing a giant heavy flywheel, turn upon turn, building momentum until a point of breakthrough, and beyond.
