A strongly catalysing organisation like the Climate Rescue Catalyst Group needs to have independent “open space” structures along side it so that people who are activated /inspired by its work can develop projects independently.  If the Climate Rescue Catalyst Group sees enough synergy with any of these projects then the Catalyst Group could negotiate the incorporation of the project into the Catalyst Group structure.
