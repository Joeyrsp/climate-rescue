!!!Decisions in the face of uncertainty
Different types of uncertainty should impact on solutions development processes and solutions deployment.  In the case of unavoidable uncertainty and the risk of highly adverse outcomes from interventions it might be prudent to avoid interventions.  Uncertainty might be reduced by experimentally testing multiple solutions pathways and the robustness of efforts to achieve good outcomes might be increased by implementing multiple solutions approaches.
Uncertainty and over-certainty are key considerations.
