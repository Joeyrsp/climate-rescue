!!!Working across the political spectrum in democracies
In democracies governments change from time to time.  And for the health of the society and the democratic process they //''need''// to change from time to time.

If an issue is important for essentially everyone then policy stability can only be assured if all the political coalitions that could form a government are committed to the policy in broad terms.  (It would be crazy if alernating governments built and tore down the hospitals with each turn of the political cycle.)

Some changes in policy do begin with one side of politics but end up being adopted eventually by all the coalitions that could form a future government.  But the risk of driving a major change from only one side of politics is that a huge polarisation can develop that gets frozen into long lasting identity politics making stable implementation over a few cycles of government very difficult or unlikely.

This suggests that the idea of climate rescue needs to be promoted across the political spectrum.  (The high emitting industries are already using this strategy for their own purposes.)
