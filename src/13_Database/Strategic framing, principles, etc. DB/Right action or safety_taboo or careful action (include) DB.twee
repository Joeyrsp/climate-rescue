It would be easy to assume that at the heart of the concern about climate is a desire for safety and wellbeing.  After all, most communication about why we should act on climate is contextualised in this way - we need to do 'x' to protect 'y' or we care about 'x', we need to do 'y'.

But it is well known in psychology[[(*)|Psychology of motivation_PrinEtc]] and philosophy[[|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism]] that humans are also concerned about 'doing the right thing' rgardless of the consequences.
