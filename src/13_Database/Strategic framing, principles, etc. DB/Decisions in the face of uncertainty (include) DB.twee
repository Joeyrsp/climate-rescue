!!Decisions in the face of uncertainty and urgency
The danger from current climate conditions, evidenced by:
*the increasing severity of climate impacts over the last 20 years or so (eg. extreme weather events, desertification, sea level rise, acidification of the ocean)[[|https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/18/critical-climate-indicators-broke-records-in-2021-says-un]][[|https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/bbe6a05f6dae42f2a420cfdd7698e4b1]][[|https://library.wmo.int/index.php?lvl=notice_display&id=22080#.YoYZ59hBzj8]]
*the passing of key earth system tipping points[[|https://www.breakthroughonline.org.au/_files/ugd/148cb0_2a1626569b45453ebadad9f151e031b6.pdf]]
means that there is extreme urgency to provide protection to the climate vulnerable affected by current climate impacts and those vulnerable to the changes in earth system elements that have passed tipping points. 

But climate measures that could most likely provide near-term relief from extreme weather events or could reverse tipping points are not well researched so we don't yet know whether there would be net benefit from applying them.

So how should we make decisions (to act or not to act) in the face of strong uncertainty and the need for urgent protection?
