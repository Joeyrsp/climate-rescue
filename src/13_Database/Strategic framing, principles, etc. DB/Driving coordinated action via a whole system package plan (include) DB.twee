The currently conventional approach to climate change is to recognise that the issue (in all its ramifications) is huge â€“ well beyond what any one person or even organisation can get ever their head around in totality.  So people decide to specialise in some aspect of the issue and to hope that somebody else will cover all the rest.  But if no one has an integrated picture of issue and what needs to be done then there can be no certainty that everything that needs to thought about or done is being tackled. 

Humans clearly can handle huge complexity otherwise we wouldn't have smart phones or international air services or skyscrapers or a million other features of modern life.  The usual way this is done is to create orgnisations or networks that have some dregree of hierarchy and the people on the top of the hierarch are meant to work hard to develop a good enough overview and to manage the application of effort to the sub-projects that add up to the whole effort.
