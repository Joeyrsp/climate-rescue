!!!Driving coordinated action via a whole system package plan
The currently conventional approach to climate change is to recognise that the issue (in all its ramifications) is huge – well beyond what any one person or even organisation can get ever their head around in totality.  So people decide to specialise in some aspect of the issue and to hope that somebody else will cover all the rest.  But if no one has an integrated picture of issue and what needs to be done then there can be no certainty that everything that needs to be thought about or done is being tackled. 

Humans clearly can handle huge complexity otherwise we wouldn't have smart phones or international air services or skyscrapers or a million other features of modern life.  The usual way this is done is to create organisations or networks that have some degree of hierarchy and the people on the top of the hierarchy are meant to work hard to develop a good enough overview and to manage the application of effort to sub-projects that add up to the whole effort.

But sometimes (often?) the top of the hierarchy is not handling a complex and important issue well and then the solution is 'managing upwards' – people or organisations that are normally seen as low in the hierarchy, the bit players, have to take on responsibility for that whole and to figure out how to make the hierarchy improve its performance to the degree necessary to handle the challenging issue.

For this managing upwards approach to work, everyone needs to have their own integrated 'whole system package' plan.  Each person's system plan will need to be as complicated as necesary and as complicated as they can manage.
