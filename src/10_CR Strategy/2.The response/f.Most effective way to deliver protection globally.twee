!!The most effective way to deliver protection — globally
Priority should be given to solution measures that have the biggest global benefit– so that the rich world doesn’t get absorbed in its own expensive local adaptation – leaving all else to suffer or perish.  Earth-system-level responses are likely to have the greatest global benefit – dollar for dollar – provided the measures are safe – because the one program of action provides global benefit.
