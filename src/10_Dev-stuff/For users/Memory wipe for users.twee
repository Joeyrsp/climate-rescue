!!In case you need to wipe the Adviser's long term memory
Between sessions, the Adviser remembers choices you have made and text you have entered.  This means that you can close your browser or reload the Adviser and the Adviser will remember your previous choices. 

But if you want to start over with a clean slate, then click on the link below.  <font color=red>But before doing that, bear in mind that ''the memory wipe is irreversible''.</font>

If you have created any custormised Output Reports you might want to copy the text to a word processing document before wiping the Adviser's memory.  There are instructions on how to get the content of an Output Report into a word processing document at the bottom of the Output Report pages.
