!!!Ideas for:


''1. Getting organised to create or revise a current action checklist''

* Chain of responsibility


''2. Preparing to go into emergency mode''

* Building initial capacity
* Has the government declared a climate emergency?
* administration - set up chain of responsibility
* Situation assessment / threat assessment
* intense preparation
* opinion polling
* education and deliberative democracy program
* Cautious governments might do a fair bit of preparation before 'declaring' a climate emergency and are likely to follow an initial 'declaration' with further preparation before switching to full-on emergency mode.
* culture shifts: total responsibility; maximum protection 
* identify discretionary budgey (legally defined; politically defined)
* staff training
* culture shift (to emergency mode) - for government people
* developing an administrative approaches for climate emergency mode
* test community mandate preparedness - to see what gaps need to be closed.
* harnessing community volunteers 
* dealing with the potential for major protests
* dealing with the potential for a crackdown by higher level governments that are controlled by the fossil fuel industry and allies. 

''3. Triggering/accelerating the switch to emergency mode''
* opinion polling
* referendum
