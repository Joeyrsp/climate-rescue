The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said its long-time monitoring station at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, averaged 421 parts per million of carbon dioxide for the month of May 2022, which is when the crucial greenhouse gas hits its yearly high.  NOAA said carbon dioxide levels are now about the same as 4.1 to 4.5 million years ago in the Pliocene era, when temperatures were 3.9C hotter and sea levels were 5 to 25 metres higher than now.
