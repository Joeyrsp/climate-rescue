Because excess greenhouse gas emissions have been going on for so long at such a large scale, these excess emissions have created a series of additional problems that now have to be dealt with in their own right if we are to protect the climate vulnerable:
*the level of greenhouse //''gases''// (CO<sub>2</sub>, methane, etc.) in the air is way too high[[(*)|Where 2022 CO2 sits in climate history_PrinEtc]], [[(*)|Methane levels_PrinEtc]]
*the global //''temperature''// is way too high (even at the current level of +1.2Â°C)
*the //''heat content''// of the //''oceans''// is too high
*the //''acidification''// of the oceans is too high
*the //''loss of ice''// from the ice sheets and the Arctic Ocean is too high
*the melting of the //''permafrost''// is too high.
