!!!Managing the perceived and actual difficulty of climate rescue action


*Complexity
*Sense of taboo
*Difficulty compared to mainstream climate change action - the enormity of what needs to be done
*Difficulty to change current action paradigm - including the lack of social reinforcement (sense of validity/legitimacy) and the current thinness of the campaign support infrastructure
