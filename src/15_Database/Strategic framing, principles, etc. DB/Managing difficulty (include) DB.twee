:: Managing difficulty (include) DB
Many factors contribute to the perceived and actual difficulty of taking effective climate rescue action:
*Complexity[[(*)|Complexity_StratFrame]]
*Sense of taboo[[(*)|Right action or safety_taboo or careful action_StratFrame]] â€“ attached to restoring safe earth system conditions
*Difficulty compared to mainstream climate change action and the enormity of what needs to be done
*Difficulty to change current action paradigm - including the lack of social reinforcement (sense of validity/legitimacy) and the current thinness of the campaign support infrastructure
Complexity and the sense of taboo have been explored already.
