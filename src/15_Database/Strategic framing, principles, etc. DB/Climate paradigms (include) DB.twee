:: Climate paradigms (include) DB
The main climate action paradigms (in the climate rescue context) are:
*the //''conventional climate action paradigm''// that focuses on:
**emissions reduction
**meeting the Paris temperature targets (trying to stabilise the temperature at +1.5°C or well below +2°C)
**creating a net zero emissions economy by 2050
**adapting to impacts of whatever climate change is occurring.
*the //''climate rescue paradigm''// that focuses on:
**identifying the climate protection needs of the climate vulnerable, required by when
**delivering timely protection for the climate vulnerable, with emphasis given to earth system protection measures (to maximise the protection of all the climate vulnerable globally).
