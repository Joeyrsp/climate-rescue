:: Duty of care-chain of responsibility_five-step process for CR (include) DB
The duty of care/chain of responsibility approach (systematic protection)  implies a need for a five-step process:
*beginning with a duty of care for civil society climate action groups and governments â€“ to protect all people and other living things globally
*the identification of the conditions (at the earth system level and locally) that are needed to protect the climate vulnerable
*the identification of what actions are needed by when to deliver the conditions needed to protect the climate vulnerable (people and other living things etc.)
*the creation of a program or system to drive the delivery of the needed protection actions
*the implementation of the actions required to provide the needed protection, fast and reliably.
