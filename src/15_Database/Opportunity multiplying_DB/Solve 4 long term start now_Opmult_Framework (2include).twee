There are a number of good reasons why you should try to generate solutions with the long term in mind. The first is that once you reject a purely self centred approach there is no reason why you should not consider, as far as you are capable, the needs of all future generations rather than just the immediate one. Furthermore many so-called solutions to problems are nothing more than devices to shift the burden into the future.  Solving for the long term, at least conceptually, closes off this approach. Furthermore over the long haul, for quasi-immortal entities (like families, corporations and other major human institutions, and living species) the means of achieving private and public good tend to converge and coincide to a large degree.
