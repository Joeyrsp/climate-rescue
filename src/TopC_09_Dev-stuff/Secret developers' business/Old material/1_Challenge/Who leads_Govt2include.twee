Who should be involved in preparing your draft action checklist for the stage of emergency work that your government is involved in now?  Which specific people should be involved?

To get a handle on this you might want to have a look at the [[where to start|Where to start?]] passage and the topics list passages on [[preparing|Topics list--Preparing]], [[switching|Topics list--Switching]] and [[operating|Topics list--Operating]].
