!The global Climate Rescue IT strategy
''//Philip://'' I've got a whole new evolutionary leap in mind growing out of the adviser project.

Already part of the design is the idea that the adviser would prompt a human-to-human conversation between the user and climate rescue core campaigners.

Then I started thinking more about the 'database' aspect of the adviser and then the independent version of the database and it occurred to me that campaigners around the world could feed information/ideas/strategies etc. to the central organisers to include in the database. via the CR website.  Plus some local or specialist CR campaigns might choose to use twine to develop advisers for their specialised  purposes. 

So this keeps evolving eventually into a global CR IT strategy.
