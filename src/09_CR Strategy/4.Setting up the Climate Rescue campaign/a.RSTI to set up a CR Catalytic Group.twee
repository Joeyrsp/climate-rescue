!!RSTI to set up a CR Catalytic Group
The non-profit organisation, RSTI, has initiated a Climate Rescue campaign to promote the adoption of the maximum protection approach (as described in this paper) in all countries across the world and at the international level.  RSTI’s work on the Climate Rescue campaign will be driven by the Climate Rescue Catalyst Group.

Given the scale of the task of catalysing a climate rescue program to deliver maximum protection, and given the diversity of cultural and administrative conditions around the world, a Climate Rescue program is likely to be more successful if it is pursued by a coalition of cooperating groups rather than by a single organisation.
