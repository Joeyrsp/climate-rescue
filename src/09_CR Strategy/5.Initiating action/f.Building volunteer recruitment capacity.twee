!!Building volunteer recruitment capacity (activists and experts)
Each country activation unit needs to develop a strategy for maximising the volunteers, (activist and expert) and the information sources (through research groups and other bodies) available to the Climate Rescue campaign and its three sub-campaigns.

Volunteers might contribute to country-level activity or they might contribute to global or regional support units of the Climate Rescue Catalyst Group or alliance partners.
