!!The most effective way to deliver protection globally
Priority should be given to solutions measures that have the biggest global benefit– so that the rich world doesn’t get absorbed in its own expensive local adaptation – leaving all else to suffer or perish.  Earth-system-level responses are likely to have the greatest global benefit – dollar for dollar – provided the measures are safe – because the one program of action provides global benefit.
