!!How much protection? - maximum
In the world of climate science, it is common for reseach papers to calibrat predictions by say they have a 50:50 chance of occurring


management purposes for goals

types of goals

what is the approach adopted by RSTI's[[(*)|Definitions, acronyms, concepts (gather)]] Climate Rescue campaign?


If we are to maximise the protection of the climate vulnerable (human and other living things), a very different approach to climate action will be needed.


Maximum Protection – a new climate goal
We need a new goal on which we can rebuild climate action ie. to provide maximum protection  for all humans and other living things.  In support of this goal we need to:
•	restore optimum, naturally safe climate and ocean pH (alkalinity) conditions within the Holocene range, as fast as possible
•	provide ‘safe passage’ conditions during the transition to the naturally regulated safe climate for all people and other living things – so that they can survive long enough to benefit from a restored safe climate and ocean alkalinity.
