If we are to maximise the protection of the climate vulnerable (human and other living things), a very different approach to climate action will be needed.

The whole human population (now nearly 8 billion) and all other living things (untold trillions) and species (tens of millions) depend on the existence of a climate and ocean alkalinity that they are adapted to.
