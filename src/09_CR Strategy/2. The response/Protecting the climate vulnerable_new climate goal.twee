!!Protecting the climate vulnerable: A new climate goal

How can we frame better goals than those established by the UN Framework Concention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement?

In "Climate Code Red: The case for emergency action"[[(*)|Climate Code Red_Ref_brief]] it was proposed that the goal should be to protect "all people, all species, all generations" and that the high level action response should be to "restore a safe climate" that people and other species are adapted to.

But given the severity of the climate change that has built up over the last 40 years and the dangerous condition that the earth system has already reached, we need a supplementary goal that sharpens our focus on dealing with near-term impacts as a complement to the longer term restoration of a naturally safe climate.

</table>Anchoring climate action on protecting the climate vulnerable is a strong test because if there is no commitment to protect the climate vulnerable then in practice climate action goals are simply lowered every time they become a bit difficult to achieve.

To protect the climate vulnerable, we will need to:
*restore a safe climate
*provide 'safe passage' for the climate vulnerable so that they can survice while the safe climate is being restored.
