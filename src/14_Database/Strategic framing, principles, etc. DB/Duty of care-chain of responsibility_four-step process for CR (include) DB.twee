:: Duty of care-chain of responsibility_four-step process for CR (include) DB
The duty of care/chain of responsibility approach (systematic protection)  implies a need for a four-step process:
*beginning with a duty of care for civil society climate action groups and governments â€“ to protect all people and other living things globally
*the identification of what actions are needed by when  to protect people and other living things, especially the climate vulnerable
*the creation of a program or system to drive the delivery of the needed protection
*actions to provide the needed protection, fast and reliably.
