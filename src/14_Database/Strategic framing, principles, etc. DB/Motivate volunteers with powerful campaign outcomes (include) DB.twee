!!!Motivate volunteers with powerful campaign outcome
The reward for volunteers is not money but the good feeling that comes from facilitating effective action.  So even at the earliest stages of action, people will be more motivated if they can see how the action they are contributing to will unfold to reach a point of high impact in the word.  Having a vision of a successful end state helps to create a psychological pull effect for actions needed earlier in the delivery process.
