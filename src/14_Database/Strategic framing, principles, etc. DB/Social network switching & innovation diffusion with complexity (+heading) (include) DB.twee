!!!Social network switching and innovation diffusion â€“ in the context of complexity
It is usually easier to shift and stabilise the views and behaviours of people with social reinforcement in small social networks rather than large ones.  Complex ideas need wide, strong bridges to move from person to person or from organisation to organisation.  Climate Rescue ideas are generally so complex that they need the active involvement of fostering organisations and often case-by-case strategy to transfer from social network to social network or from organisation to organisation.  And to trigger action most people will need to be engaged in supportive social networks or organisations.  Spreading ideas in the absence of social reinforcement is not likely to be enough to trigger the needed change.
