!!The 'break glass' scenario
At last the move to shift the economy to zero emissions is gathering pace, but despite this we are about to surge past the Paris +1.5°C 'goal' (by about 2030).  With more effort on zero emissions and a large amount of CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown the global temperature might peak between +2°C and +3°C. The environmental conditions at such temperatures will be unbearable, and there is also a very serious risk that the earth system might be tripped into a new stable much higher temperature - a [["hothouse earth"|Hothouse earth_GScenario]] state. So, as the climate conditions deteriorate, at some stage some powerful forces might decide that it is time to "break the glass" and add fast cooling methods[[(*)|Fast cooling methods_Def (get)]] to the climate action tool kit.  At that point it would be wise to have a strong science research base and knowledge of deployment technology so that seriously ignorant decisions are not made.
