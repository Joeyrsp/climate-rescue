!!!The climate vulnerable
The climate vulnerable include people and other living things that are suffering now or face future impacts from extreme weather events (fires, floods, storms, heatwaves, droughts, coastal storm surges, ecosystem breakdown) and systematic changes such as in temperatures, sea-level rise and ocean acidity[[(*)|Ocean acidification not a climate issue_comment (2include) DB]].  Young people as a whole are among the climate vulnerable because their future lives face hugely intensified climate-change-induced impacts unless drastic action is taken now.
