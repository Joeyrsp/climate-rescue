!!!Safe climate restoration
Given that climate impacts have already reached unacceptable levels, it is important to recognise that safe climate restoration should be part of a climate rescue program.  That is, the aim should not be to stabilise the climate at the currently bad state or an even worse state.  The aim should be to return the climate to a safe pre-global-warming climate that is optimal for the climate vulnerable.
