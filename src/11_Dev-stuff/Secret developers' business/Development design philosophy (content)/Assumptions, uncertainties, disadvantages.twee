!!Assumptions, uncertainties, disadvantages
Adam Grant's book "Think again" highlights (p. 211) the value of people questioning their assumptions, exposing their uncertainties and being open about disadvantages.  This encourages a learning culture that encourages rethinking and continual improvement.

Key questions to ask are:
* What leads to those assumptions? Why do you think they are correct?  What might happen if they are wrong?
* What are the uncertainties in the analysis?
* The advantages of the recomxmendations are clear.  But what might the disadvantages be?
