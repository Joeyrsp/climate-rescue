!Old Material:<BR> from a previous project that is being merged into the Climate Rescue Adviser.

This Adviser is being built on the structure, content and coding of an earlier project - a guide for getting into climate action in emergecny mode.  As the new Adviser is built up the old material will be either incorporated or deleted if it no longer needed. 

The Climate Rescue Adviser will also be integrated with the new elements of the Climate Rescue website that will begin development shortly.

Here's what remains of the older guide:

[[Intro & selecting a challenge]]
[[Setting up a climate emergency action program]]
[[Preparatory action for going into emergency mode|Preparing]]
[[Switching into emergency mode|Switching]]
[[Operating in emergency mode|Operating]]
[[Draft action checklist]]
