:: Developing a fast cooling program (private notes) [Twine.private]



I bumped into Carol Ride at the forum - that's the Carol Ride who is one of the initial members of the RSTI oversight committee.  We talked a bit about the new developments with RSTI and then got onto discussing the protection of the climate vulnerable, and eventually got onto the subject of fast cooling.

Carol told me that she can't imagine fast cooling ever being deployed because there will never be a global consensus on doing it and trying to do it without a global consensus would likely lead to war.  so for her, that's the end of the matter.

These are ideas that are being promoted by the anti-fast cooling campaign - so we will have to think through these issues.
